*Containerizing python application using docker*

**What is Containerization?**
  
  *Containerization is a software deployment process that bundles an applicationâ€™s code with all the files and libraries it needs to run on any infrastructure.*
  *Containerization enables software developers to build, deploy, and manage applications more efficiently and effectively.*
  
  **Why to containerize an application?** 
  
  *Portability: Containerization enables software developers to deploy applications in multiple environments without rewriting the program code.*
  
  *Scalability: Containers are lightweight software components that run efficiently. Therefore, software developers can easily add multiple containers for different 
                applications on a single machine.*
                
  *Isolation:   Containerization provides isolation between different services/application running within same machine*
    
  **What is docker and what are its components** 
  
  *Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers. 
   Containers are standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that 
   code in any environment*

  The Docker Engine is the core component of Docker and consists of three parts:

   Server:    It is the Docker daemon called dockerd. It can create and manage Docker images, containers, networks, etc.
   REST API:    It is used to instruct the Docker daemon what to do.
   Command Line Interface (CLI):    It is a client that is used to enter Docker commands
  
 

Step 1: Host an python application 

Step 2: Install file beat on server1 to collect logs

Step 3: Configure logstash to collect the logs from filebeat

Step 4: Configure Kibana gui to view server 1's logs

Step 5: Create a python flask application and generate application logs in server2

Step 6: Enable connectivity between server1 and server2 to send and receive logs

Step 7: Install filebeat on server2 and configure it to send its logs to Servers 1's logstash

Step 8: Update the config file of logstash and filebeat in server1 to differentiate the logs being collected from both these servers by filebeat

Step 9: Configure kibana gui to view the logs generated by server2 aswell
